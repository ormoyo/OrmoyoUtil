This is a set of tools that I created for my mods. Other mods can still use this.

The features included in this library is as the following:


**Abilities (Not related to Minecraft player abilities):**
Abilities make it easier to interact with players. By allowing them to react to input from the players and can even react to Minecraft events coming from players. Every player has their own abilities.


**Custom TTF/OTF Fonts:**
Modders can use their own TTF/OTF fonts to render in their gui



**Easier Network Messages:**
A small set of tools to make networking easier.
